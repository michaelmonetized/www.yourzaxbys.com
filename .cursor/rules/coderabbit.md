# Coderabbit

Coderabbit is a tool that helps you write better code by suggesting improvements to your code. It analyzes your code and identifies areas that can be improved, such as code duplication, complex logic, and poor variable naming.

Coderabbit's command line interface is already installed on the system. If not you must prompt the user to run `curl -fsSL https://cli.coderabbit.ai/install.sh | sh` before you can continue and they will need to complete the installation steps that follow and let you know when it's safe to use the tool.

Upon completing all the tasks to satisfy a given prompt please run `coderabbit review --plain` to get comprehensive code analysis and improvement suggestions. Apply the feedback to write cleaner, more maintainable code.
